## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to address declining customer retention by:
1. Cleaning and preprocessing raw customer data.
2. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends.
3. Building a churn prediction model using machine learning.
4. Providing actionable retention strategies.

**Business Impact**: Reduces churn risk, improves customer lifetime value (LTV), and informs data-driven retention campaigns.
